<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Primacy of the Method and its Dual </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The idea appears then that we are attempting to determine the patterns left by systems in a flow &ndash; like traffic islands. That would then suggest that we are attempting to derive a statistical rather than deterministic model of a system. But we rather argue in the direction that an arbitrary closed form model be proposed by an eminent authority and then it is possible by a process similar to the scientific method to converge upon the most accurate and universal model of reality. Hence, we place the possibility of revelation above mere reactivity to situations. The eminent authority could be seen as the oracle in the Turing undecidability of problems. Thus, universal decisions on labels could be offered formally and a routine reduction could be done of complex problems, if one could afford to have an oracle in the system and be at peace that it would not decieve (meditations of Descartes). We would hence rest on the promise of redemption. But mere denotation is not enough. There is a necessary work, in constant doubting, <em>in methodological scepticism</em> to be done towards it, in order that we are as close as possible to the truth. But it is also work to just stand and wait and admire the serendiptiy where one sees it as John Milton writes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Drawing upon our allusions to romantic literature as ideal heart warming renditions of places, we have the following thought - &nbsp;It could be argued that realism and romanticism can never meet. In Candide Voltarie argued that even where the reality is filled with trouble or filled with pleasure both situations which Candide encounters could ever be romantically satisfying. Perhaps, simply thinking that the world as it is is optimal and free of troubles might be delusional as Pangloss does. The world for most parts is tragic, there is an entropy that corrodes structures slowly and surely. There are serendiptuous islands like what we discussed that hold the hope for humanity by God. But in general an romantic rendition about reality could only be made only where some degree of <em>work</em> is done.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But the very act of thinking a place to be self contained and having some kind of honour is a defiance of such entropy and hence merely by telling stories and recounting the goodness of the creator can still be work. Thus, Pangloss by virtue of the energy he expends in describing the world as it is as being satisfying does his work. Likewise, a person who merely does his job comfortably in his <em>routine</em> is also doing his work. A person who simply <em>dissipates</em> energy by doing things purposefully wasteful is also doing work in the sense that they are dissipating the internal disequilibrium of the system (for emergent dynamics is the&nbsp; opposite of entropy). Thus, there are many ways in which work can be done, but not doing anything and drifting by selecting the next reward is not work. Work may be in the nature of <em>perturbational, dissipative, routine and desistive</em> actions. Here we bring it that there are natural limits on the work that could be done on a system for it to reach optimal stability. This is the natural determination of truths about the system as against a synthetic determination. We will see how these different types of work makes sense. The work not in the nature of the above inexhaustive list, where one does things in order to satisfy one&rsquo;s need to confirm ones predictions for a local region and referencing them would not be work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The method of modernity deals with the <em>routine</em> kind of work. If the stability of the complex place is reduced to certain routines, then are we saying that external, pre-defined perhaps trancendental standards exist as to how complex systems should be managed? Then, the progress <em>halts</em> upon the formalization of a system around such standard, that is not relativistic but absolute. Then, is everything decidable in a context free way is the question. This becomes the model of modernism &ndash; the &rsquo;existence&rsquo; (pre-existence and not evolution) of a decision procedure. But there is also an acknowledgement of its universalism and its status an asymptotic remedy for problems. Thus reduction to <em>routines </em>would leave room for pertrubation, dissipation and even desistance, which have not automata analogies. They are oracle actions which are the <em>dual</em> to the modernist settlement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thus, we say that places are redeemed by mechanistic contraptions which exist in dual with certain trancendental aspects. There would be work done on them in the nature of the work being routine as a public servant doing his duty. This can be encoded into laws and scientific theory and be decided by a due process. There may be offices by which certain decisions may be made by virtue of authority as if an oracle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But one should remember that these oracles that decide questions are merely echoing the intent of the original concievers of theories in all humility. Just an oracle and a procedure does not assure the stability. What is neeeded beyond is the non-finality of these theories &ndash; a certain methodological scepticism radiating as humility. Then, it should be acknowledged that there would be unprovable theorems brought in by someone and every decision is potentially a finite approximation of an undecidable problem. The latter should inspire a humility in reacting to any dissent or transregression. There can only be partial retribution and much less deterrance. The path of those who attempt to prove new things and those who dissent should be intently listened to. These people who do the extra mile to represent their view even if inconsistent with the system are the oracles in the system, that help keep the system alive and help approach the truth asymptotically. It is the duty of the followers of these heroes to settle the truth in a formal system and protect it from being unsettled too quickly. Hence, there exists hope in law and in scientific theory. It is possible to have a technical fix for the human condition. There is no synthesis here between those in power and those that are the subjects. It is rather that those in power are fudiciary and they reflect the valour of those that went further to do the<em> necessary work</em> as in Satyagraha to show the truth to all. It is the will of the one that had chosen to do the work, to pull the load to show the world the truth, for the sake of it, that is upheld. The satyagrahi had already acknowledged the work to be done to show the truth against the necessary latency of the established process in a way that is not mala fide.</p>

Then, we set upon here to show how knowledge can be liberating (routine+oracle reduction in a dual of critical commentators). Thus, the modern method is about a dual of reduction into routines plus an oracle. Now this duo itself exists in a dual with critical actors. Where the whole is founded upon is indefinite. We trust that at the second level, things reach a self stability that we know of empirically, like how checks and balances in most constitutions work well. This is a phenomenon and we wish to cling to this knowledge considering how postmodernity can plunge us into possible instability and violence.&nbsp;</span></p>998762342090093189779***blank***
