LC - reviving cartesian science
=========================
motivation -> Scepticism, past works inspirations
exposition -> how scholastic science exists and how postmodernity/modernity is a cancelling out
adaptation -> real life design recommendations, criticism, collaborations
campus -> the limitations of formalism, open exploratory activities, campus before concept.

				 	Remembering C Truesdell
				 	Reconciling Classicism with Romanticism
				 	Renaissance as a sensation rather than an event. 
				 	Romanticism as a complement to Classicism
